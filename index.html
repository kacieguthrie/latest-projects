                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Independent woodworkers often have the skills and desire to build high-quality furniture,
                  but lack the time, skills, and resources to market their services and manage their business.
                  Teak and Timber aims to make handmade furniture more accessible and bring job offers to woodworkers. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>Build project management portal that would allow woodworkers to accept,
                  manage, and get paid for projects online while helping administrators
                  keep an eye on their progress and address potential jam ups.
                  For the first version, we were not accepting custom orders; only items
                  from our catalog of established designs.

              <p>
                While I was learning about woodworker’s motivations, goals, and frustrations, I developed protopersonas -- theoretical personas based partially on interviews,
                partially on personal experience, and partially on our best guesses. Everyone on our
                team was an experienced woodworker, but we wanted to make sure we were getting a range of perspectives.
                These interviews validated some of our assumptions and gave us new insights. </p>
              <h3>Insights and Validations:</h3>
              <ul class="">
                <li><p>Most woodworkers were doing this part-time, so most of them didn’t have a dedicated office and
                  in some cases didn’t have a formalized business process. Each project was handled ad hoc. </p></li>
                <li><p>Their goals were organization and communication - some estimated
                  they spent up to 20% of their time going back and forth with the client. </p></li>
                <li><p>Finding woodworking commissions could be feast or famine,
                  so it was important to be flexible in the amount of work they were willing/able to take on.</p></li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="">

              <h3>Revised Process Flow</h3>
              <p>As we learned more about what we needed to build, the original process changed, too.
                  We learned that it wasn’t that important for customers to be able to pick their woodworker
                  (an element that had previously required us to build our own ecommerce portal from scratch).
                  We re-centered our efforts with a shared understanding of all the pieces that needed to be built. </p>
              <p>This was an important learning point for us. In hindsight, the whole reason we had to build the
                    ecommerce platform from scratch was based on a hypothesis that we hadn’t validated with research. </p>
            </div>
          </section>

            <div>
              <h6>Sketches and Wireframes</h6>
            </div>
            <div class="">
              <h2>Sketches</h2>
              <p>Quality assessment was a big question for our business model. After revisiting
                the process for managing a job, I realized this needed to be a
                checklist of items that woodworkers needed to report to us as they progressed in their projects. </p>
              <h2>Mockups</h2>
              <p>I wasn’t planning on making hi-fi mockups for this part.
                Branding wasn't our highest priority, so we planed to
                use Material UI since it works well with React and we could move pretty quickly.
                I ended up making the mockups because we had some interns working with
                us who needed a more solid “source of truth” for what the UI should look like.
                It also allowed me to do some remote testing before we started building</p>
              <p>We decided to focus on the mobile version --the desktop version was a
                slightly larger version of the mobile app with the menu as a sidebar.
                Most folks have a mobile device these days, but not all of our woodworkers would have
                a desktop in their shop because of the dust. We knew parts of our process would
                require them to upload photos, so we encouraged them to use it on a mobile device. </p>
              <h2>Early Testing</h2>
              <p>gave some insights into navigation issues. Even though every page was
                accessible and the browser app allowed users to utilize the back button,
                it was better to have a back button built into the interface. </p>
